          <h1>Hey, I'm Marco Pennekamp</h1>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a strong interest in <b>functional programming</b> and
            <b>programming languages.</b> My current go-to language is <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
            but I have worked and do work with an extensive range of languages. These include Haskell, Javascript,
            Python, Java, Lua, Typescript, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love languages, both artificial and natural. I am interested in the design and implementation of
            programming languages, and have created smaller languages such as <a href="https://github.com/Collap/bryg">bryg</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/marcopennekamp/eemo2">eemo</a>, as well as concepts for larger languages,
            of which the most recent one is <a href="https://github.com/marcopennekamp/lore">lore</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My native language is German, but I am equally comfortable with English, in which I do most of my reading
            and writing. I still come across new words that I want to learn and use in my own writing. Simply looking
            up a word doesn't cut it. This is why I am creating <b>Diceres</b>. Diceres combines a dictionary with a
            spaced-repetition system, so you can learn your words directly from the dictionary, without having to write
            your own flashcards or learn from predetermined lists.
          </p>

        <div class="column col-8">
          <p>
            In 2017, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b> from the
            <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/en/Home/index.html">Technical University of Dortmund</a>.
            My <a href="bachelorarbeit.pdf">Bachelor's thesis</a> in the field of software synthesis explored automata
            simulation during type inhabitation. I deeply appreciate the formal methods, proofs and structures in
            Computer Science, which is why I am continuing my education in the field. Being able to utilise results
            from Computer Science research can be a great boon for any software engineer.

              <b>Diceres</b> is an upcoming web service combining a dictionary with a spaced-repetition system. Users can
              learn words directly from the dictionary, without having to write their own flashcards or learn from
              predetermined lists. It is being implemented using the Play Framework, Scala, PostgreSQL, and VueJS.

              <b>Bryg</b> is a statically typed markup language that compiles to JVM bytecode. It supports the generation
              of HTML and other textual formats, as well as typical programming language constructs such as expressions,
              conditions, loops, variables and functions. Interoperability with Java is supported. It was implemented with
