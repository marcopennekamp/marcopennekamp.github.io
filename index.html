          <h1>Hey, I'm Marco Pennekamp</h1>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a strong interest in <b>functional programming</b> and
            <b>programming languages.</b> My current go-to language is <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
            but I have worked and do work with an extensive range of languages. These include Haskell, Javascript,
            Python, Java, Lua, Typescript, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love languages, both artificial and natural. I am interested in the design and implementation of
            programming languages, and have created smaller languages such as <a href="https://github.com/Collap/bryg">bryg</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/marcopennekamp/eemo2">eemo</a>, as well as concepts for larger languages,
            of which the most recent one is <a href="https://github.com/marcopennekamp/lore">lore</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My native language is German, but I am equally comfortable with English, in which I do most of my reading
            and writing. I still come across new words that I want to learn and use in my own writing. Simply looking
            up a word doesn't cut it. This is why I am creating <b>Diceres</b>. Diceres combines a dictionary with a
            spaced-repetition system, so you can learn your words directly from the dictionary, without having to write
            your own flashcards or learn from predetermined lists.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2017, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b> from the
            <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/en/Home/index.html">Technical University of Dortmund</a>.
            My <a href="bachelorarbeit.pdf">Bachelor's thesis</a> in the field of software synthesis explored automata
            simulation during type inhabitation. I deeply appreciate the formal methods, proofs and structures in
            Computer Science, which is why I am continuing my education in the field. Being able to utilise results
            from Computer Science research can be a great boon for any software engineer.
