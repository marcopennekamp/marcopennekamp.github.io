          <h1>Hey, I'm Marco Pennekamp</h1>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a strong interest in <b>functional programming</b> and
            <b>programming languages.</b> My current go-to language is <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
            but I have worked and do work with an extensive range of languages. These include Haskell, Javascript,
            Python, Java, Lua, Typescript, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love languages, both artificial and natural. I am interested in how programming languages are designed
            and implemented, and have created smaller languages such as <a href="https://github.com/Collap/bryg">bryg</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/marcopennekamp/eemo2">eemo</a>, as well as concepts for larger languages,
            of which the most recent one is <a href="https://github.com/marcopennekamp/lore">lore</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My native language is German, but I am equally comfortable in English. I do most of my reading in
            English, as well as most of my non-conversational writing. I still come across some words which I
            don't know and I would like to learn them in a way that I can commit them to long-term memory. I have
            found that simply looking up the word doesn't cut it. This is why I am creating <b>Diceres</b>, a
            spaced-repetition system where you can look up an English word in a dictionary and start learning it
            right away.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2017, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b> from the Technical University of
            Dortmund. My Bachelor's thesis explored the simulation of automata during type inhabitation in the
            context of software synthesis. I deeply appreciate the formal methods, proofs and results in Computer
            Science, which is why I am continuing my education in the field. I think being able to utilise results
            from Computer Science research can be a great boon for any software engineer.
