          <h1>Hey, I'm Marco Pennekamp</h1>
          <p>
            I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and musician. I work on my own projects full-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an entrepreneur, I am currently involved with two projects. <a href="https://kaynef.de"><b>Kaynef</b></a>
            is a new fashion brand that sells accessories crafted for cyclists. Our first product is a men's bracelet
            made from bicycle tires. <a href="https://wordpace.app"><b>Wordpace</b></a> is an English vocabulary
            learning tool for writers and readers. Focus on the words you need and stop learning from lists. With
            Wordpace, you simply select your vocabulary from a hassle-free dictionary.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software engineer, I have a strong interest in <b>functional programming</b> and
            <b>programming languages.</b> My current go-to language is <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
            but I have worked and do work with an extensive range of languages. These include Javascript, Haskell,
            Python, Java, Lua, Typescript, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a musician, I play bass in a rock band called <b>Among Those People</b>. I am very fond of our composition
            process, which involves every member of the band and has lead to some very interesting songs. With my bass,
            I strive to create music, not just basslines. We are currently working on our first album.
          </p>

        <div class="column col-4 col-sm-12"><h3>Education</h3></div>
        <div class="column col-8 col-sm-12">
          <p>
            In 2017, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b> from the
            <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/en/Home/index.html">Technical University of Dortmund</a>.
            My <a href="bachelorarbeit.pdf">Bachelor's thesis</a> was in the field of software synthesis. It explored
            automata simulation during type inhabitation. I deeply appreciate the formal methods, proofs and structures
            in Computer Science. Being able to utilise results from Computer Science research can be a great boon for
            any software engineer.
