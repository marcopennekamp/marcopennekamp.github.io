              I acquired a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b> from the
              <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/en/Home/index.html">Technical University of Dortmund</a>.
              I graduated "mit Auszeichnung" ("with distinction") and achieved the second-best possible mark of 1.1 (on
              a grade scale of 1.0 to 4.0) with an ECTS Grade of A. My courses focused on broad Computer Science concepts,
              but in later semesters I also took electives in functional programming, compiler construction,
              computer graphics, theoretical computer science, knowledge representation and reasoning, and data science.
              I wrote my <a href="bachelorarbeit.pdf">Bachelor's thesis</a> (German) in the field of software synthesis.

            As a software engineer, I have a strong interest in <b>functional programming</b> and
            <b>programming languages.</b> My current go-to languages are <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>
            for general-purpose and backend work and Javascript for frontend work, but I have worked with an extensive
            range of languages in the past. These include Java, Python, Haskell, Typescript, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am experienced in <b>web development</b> across the stack. I have built backends for Wordpace and Collap
            mostly using Scala and the Play Framework. I have used Hugo and Tailwind to build static sites (such as the
            Kaynef shop, and the Wordpace landing page/blog) and love working with Vue.js for my frontend needs.
            NuxtJS allowed me to build <a href="https://nstb.ink">nstb.ink</a> using Vue.js, which I'm very excited
            about. I have designed relational database schemas from the ground up, using mostly PostgreSQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over almost a decade of actively programming I've had many <b>interests</b>, including graphics and game programming
            (building many game prototypes with OpenGL and C++ or Java), language design and implementation (such as a
            templating language compiled directly to JVM bytecode), virtual machines (studying the JVM, and building my
            own prototype VM), game modding, and, of course, web development.

            I write novels and short stories at the crossroads of <b>fantasy and the paranormal</b>, combining my love
            for imaginative worlds, weird fiction, vivid dreams, and captivating accounts of hauntings and cryptids.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started <b>writing seriously</b> in October 2018 and have since finished two novel drafts, several short
            stories, and a novella. In 2019, I wrote over 300,000 words and intend to continue that pace going into
            the new decade. Even though my native language is German, I write entirely in English, as I simply prefer
            it both in reading and in writing.

            In February 2019, I created a Discord writing community called <b>NSTB</b>, which I have been leading and developing
            continually. Our main draw is the 6-month novel writing challenge: We challenge ourselves to write a first
            draft within six months, starting in March and September. We have grown steadily and as of April 2020
            have about 800 registered members. Find us on <a href="https://nstb.ink">nstb.ink</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building this community has been an extensive <b>learning experience</b> for me. I am continually improving
            my community management skills and am looking forward to developing the community even further.
