          <h1>Hey, I'm Marco Pennekamp</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a <b>software engineer, writer and musician</b>. On this website, I intend to give you an
            overview of my projects, interests, work experience and education.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing my Computer Science degree in late 2017, I had the pleasure to work on my own projects and
            ideas throughout 2018 and 2019. You can see more detailed descriptions of my efforts in the various sections
            below. Going into the new decade, I am seeking <b>fresh opportunities</b> as a software engineer.
          </p>

              I acquired a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b> from the
              <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/en/Home/index.html">Technical University of Dortmund</a>.
              I graduated "mit Auszeichnung" ("with distinction") and achieved the second-best possible mark of 1.1 (on
              a grade scale of 1.0 to 4.0) with an ECTS Grade of A. My courses focused on broad Computer Science concepts,
              but in later semesters I also took electives in functional programming, compiler construction,
              computer graphics, theoretical computer science, knowledge representation and reasoning, and data science.
              I wrote my <a href="bachelorarbeit.pdf">Bachelor's thesis</a> (German) in the field of software synthesis.

            As a software engineer, I have a strong interest in <b>functional programming</b> and
            <b>programming languages.</b> My current go-to languages are <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>
            for general-purpose and backend work and Javascript for frontend work, but I have worked and do work with an
            extensive range of languages. These include Haskell, Python, Java, Lua, Typescript, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am experienced in <b>web development</b> across the stack. I have built backends for Wordpace and Collap
            mostly using Scala and the Play Framework. I have used Hugo and Tailwind to build static sites (such as the
            Kaynef shop, and the Wordpace landing page/blog) and love working with Vue.js for my frontend needs. I have
            designed relational database schemas from the ground up, using mostly PostgreSQL, but would have no issues
            translating these skills to other DBMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over almost a decade of actively programming I've had many <b>interests</b>, including graphics and game programming
            (building many game prototypes with OpenGL and C++ or Java), language design and implementation (such as a
            templating language compiled directly to JVM bytecode), virtual machines (studying the JVM, and building my
            own prototype VM), game modding, and, of course, web development.

        <div class="column col-8 col-sm-12">
          <p>
            I write novels and short stories at the crossroads of <b>fantasy and the paranormal</b>, combining my love
            for imaginative worlds, weird fiction, vivid dreams, and captivating accounts of hauntings and cryptids.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started <b>writing seriously</b> in October 2018 and have since finished a novel, several short stories,
            and a novella. In 2019, I wrote over 300,000 words and intend to continue that pace going into the new
            decade. I am currently working on another novel and novella, whose first drafts I am aiming to finish by the
            end of February 2020. Even though my native language is German, I write entirely in English, as I simply
            prefer it both in reading and in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost all of my stories are set in a world I've been building since 2018. I am very excited to <b>share my
            work</b>, but also recognise that I still need time to mature as a writer. I am looking forward to 2020
            being the year during which I can list some published works on this website.

          <p>
            In February 2019, I created a Discord writing community called <b>NSTB</b>, which I have been leading and developing
            continually. Our main draw is the 6-month novel writing challenge: We challenge ourselves to write a first
            draft within six months, starting in March and September. We have grown steadily and as of January 2020
            have about 100 members who are active at least weekly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building this community has been an extensive <b>learning experience</b> for me. I am continually improving
            my moderation, management and leadership skills and am looking forward to develop the community even
            further. A website is forthcoming, but right now you can read more about NSTB on
            <a href="https://disboard.org/server/548262468712005663">Disboard</a>.

          <p>
            As a musician, I play bass in a rock band called <b>Among Those People</b>. I am very fond of our composition
            process, which involves every member of the band and has lead to some very interesting songs. With my bass,
            I strive to create music, not just basslines. We are currently working on our first album.
